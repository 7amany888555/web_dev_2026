                <h3>Free Static Hosting from a Repository</h3>
            </header>

            <p>GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub that allows you to publish a static website directly from a repository. Once enabled, GitHub automatically converts your repository's files into a live, publicly accessible website with its own URL. There is no need to pay for a hosting plan or configure a separate server. For students, developers, and anyone building portfolio sites or project documentation, it is one of the most convenient options available.</p>

            <p>The service works specifically with static content, meaning files that are delivered to the browser exactly as they are stored, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. It does not support server-side processing or databases. This makes it ideal for websites that are informational or presentational in nature, rather than applications that require user authentication or dynamic data.</p>

                    <h3>When to Use It</h3>
                </header>

                <p>GitHub Pages is well suited for a range of common use cases. Portfolio websites are among the most popular, as they allow developers to showcase their projects and skills with a professional-looking URL. Class projects like this one are another good fit because they are typically small, static, and benefit from being publicly visible for grading or review purposes.</p>

                <p>It also works well for project documentation, open-source software sites, and personal blogs built with static site generators. The key requirement is that your site does not need a backend. If your pages are made up of HTML files, styled with CSS, and enhanced with client-side JavaScript, GitHub Pages can handle everything without any additional configuration on your part.</p>

                <p>One practical advantage of GitHub Pages is that the site URL is tied directly to your repository. Any time you push new changes to the repository, the live site is updated automatically within a short time. This tight connection between your code and your deployment means you never have to manually upload files to a separate server, which simplifies the entire publishing process significantly.</p>

                    <h2>How I Enabled It</h2>
                    <h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>
                </header>

                <p>Enabling GitHub Pages for this project was a straightforward process that took only a few minutes. After pushing all of my HTML files to the main branch of my repository, I navigated to the repository settings on GitHub. Inside the settings, there is a dedicated section called Pages, where you can choose which branch to publish from and confirm the deployment.</p>

                <p>I selected the main branch as the source and saved the configuration. GitHub then began processing the repository and building the site. Within a minute or two, a live URL appeared in the Pages section confirming that the site was online. I copied that URL and tested each navigation link to confirm that all three pages loaded correctly and that the links between them worked as expected.</p>

                <p>After testing, I submitted both the GitHub Pages URL and the repository URL as required. One important thing I learned during this process is to always push your latest changes before checking the live site, because the hosted version will not reflect local edits until they have been committed and pushed to the repository.</p>
