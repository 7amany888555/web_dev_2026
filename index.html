                <h3>What This Site Covers</h3>
            </header>

            <p>This site is a beginner-friendly introduction to GitHub and version control. It covers what GitHub is, why it matters for developers, and how tools like GitHub Pages allow anyone to publish a website for free. Whether you are brand new to programming or just new to using Git, this guide is designed to give you a clear starting point.</p>

            <p>Version control is one of the most important skills a developer can learn. Without it, managing changes to a project becomes difficult and risky. GitHub solves this problem by giving developers a reliable, organized way to store their code and track every modification over time. Understanding these concepts early in your learning journey will save you a great deal of frustration later.</p>

                    <aside>GitHub helps store projects, track changes, and share work.</aside>
                    <h3>Repositories</h3>
                </header>

                <p>A repository, often called a repo, is the foundation of any GitHub project. It stores all of your project files, including HTML pages, images, scripts, and any other resources your site depends on. More importantly, a repository keeps a complete history of every change that has ever been made, allowing you to look back at earlier versions of your work at any time.</p>

                <p>Repositories make collaboration much safer and more organized. When multiple developers work on the same project, each person can make changes on their own branch without affecting the main codebase. Once the changes are reviewed and approved, they can be merged into the main branch. This process reduces the risk of overwriting someone else's work and keeps the project stable.</p>

                <p>Even when working alone, repositories are valuable. They act as a backup of your entire project. If something breaks, you can always return to a previous commit where everything worked correctly. This kind of safety net is something every developer, beginner or experienced, benefits from having.</p>

                    <h2>Basic Git Workflow</h2>
                    <h3>Simple Steps to Follow</h3>
                </header>

                <p>The basic Git workflow follows a simple pattern that becomes second nature with practice. First, you make changes to your files in a local folder on your computer. Then you stage those changes using the git add command, which tells Git which files you want to include in your next save point. Finally, you commit the changes with a short message describing what you did, and push them to GitHub so they are stored online.</p>

                <p>Commit messages are an important part of this workflow. A good message explains not just what changed, but why it changed. For example, writing "fix broken navigation link on about page" is far more useful than writing "update." Over time, a well-written commit history becomes a readable log of your entire project development, which is helpful both for yourself and for anyone else who might work on the project later.</p>

                <p>Using Git also protects you from accidental data loss. Since every commit is saved and tracked, you never have to worry about permanently losing your work. If you delete a file by mistake or introduce a bug, you can use Git to restore your project to the exact state it was in before the problem occurred. This makes the development process much more confident and less stressful.</p>
